Scripted Lua configuration for Go!

![boosters](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/45/020408_STS110_Atlantis_launch.jpg/1158px-020408_STS110_Atlantis_launch.jpg)

Boost is a simple configuration engine driven by Lua scripts.

## Install
This package is go get-able so I'm sure you know what to do...
(but just in case you don't â†²)

`go get github.com/cosmotek/boost`

## Example
In addition to the example below, I've included an much more detailed example in the `examples` folder.

**example.conf**
```lua
-- some global values
random = {
  one = 1,
  two = 2,
  strawberries = "red"
}

-- configuration function
MyApp.configure = function(config)
  config.favorites.fruits = {
    "apple",
    "orange"
  }

  config.favorites.color = "red"
  config.favorites.animals = true
end
```

**main.go**
```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"

	"github.com/cosmotek/boost"
	"github.com/cosmotek/boost/types"
)

type Configuration struct {
	Favorites struct {
    Color string
    Animals bool
    Fruits []string
  }
}

func main() {
	conf, err := boost.NewAppConfig(
		"MyApp",
		"example.conf",
    		// enabled debug logging
		true,
		types.NewString("name", "seth"),
	)

	defer conf.Cleanup()
	if err != nil {
		panic(err)
	}

	config := &Configuration{}
	err = conf.ParseFunction("configure", config)
	if err != nil {
		panic(err)
	}

	fmt.Println(config)
}
```

## API Coverage
At the moment all Lua stdlib packages appear to be fully functional (os, io, file, math etc..) as well as a few Gopher-Lua modules for serialization, http and utility. Native/Pure Lua libraries and C-Wrapping modules are yet to be tested. Most pure Lua code should work, anything interfacing with C should not be expected to work.

Included Gopher-Lua Modules:
+ http (http client wrapping net/http)
+ re (regex)
+ json
+ yaml
+ xmlpath
+ url (parser)
+ lfs (Lua Filesystem, not complete)

## Shout-outs

Special Thanks to the creator of https://github.com/yuin/gopher-lua which this library is almost fully dependent on.

## Contribution and maintenance

While Boost has been tested in small apps, be careful when using this library for anything in sensitive environments. If you would like to make a suggestion or report a bug, please feel free to submit a PR or issue. I really hope you enjoy using Boost! Thanks!
